# SecurityCamera_tflite
A typical web application works only when a user visits the site. In this post, we are creating an application that continues to work even if no one sees it.


tl;dr
We made a Streamlit security camera app that stays running without any user looking at the page.
Download the gist here
Download the pre-trained weights TFLite(v1, metadata) from TFHub
Start the Streamlit app as usual.
